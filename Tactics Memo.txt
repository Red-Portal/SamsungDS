Monte Carlo method
Alpha-Beta prunning (aka minimax)
depth bound or time bound
multithreading (8 concurrent threads)
priority table lookup
minimax guided monte carlo method
monte carlo methods are tipically time bound.
monte carlo methods are fast, efficient but less accurate (shallow trap)


heuristic
1. sequence over 6 are considered as 0 points.
2. sequence with both edges blocked by either the enemy or a block
   is considered as 0 points
3. sequence with one edge bound is supposed to be inferior to
   an equivalent but unbound sequence.
4. an equivalent sequence is supposed to be weighted if it's of the enemy.
5. _ | / \ a total of 4 rows for lookup. / \ rows have less lookup area
   because the edges are narrower.
